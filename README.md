# Dotfiles

My personal config, managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for easy setup and syncing.

## Quickstart

1. **Install chezmoi**   
    `pacman -S chezmoi` (or using any other package manager)

2. **Enjoy a cup of tea**  
   Sit back and relax while chezmoi applies your configs.

3. **Install dependencies**  
   This repo contains **config files only**—you’ll need to install applications or plugins (e.g., Neovim, Kitty) separately.
